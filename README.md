> **🚨 Cursor Alternative That Respects Your Privacy & Wallet**
> 
> Why pay $20/month when you can have **better AI assistance for free**? LILIA proves that ethical AI tooling isn't a luxury—it's infrastructure for the next million developers.

## 📖 About

**LILIA** is an open-source, privacy-first Visual Studio Code extension that provides AI-powered development assistance through a multi-agent system. Unlike subscription-based tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot, LILIA runs entirely locally using Ollama, ensuring complete code privacy while delivering intelligent code review, automated testing, security analysis, and documentation generation.

### 🌍 Built for Global Developers

> Initial spark: LILIA 0.1 – exiled code, beautiful terminal.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ElaMCB/LILIA.git
cd LILIA

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install Ollama (for local AI)
# Visit https://ollama.ai and install, then:
ollama pull llama2

# 4. Build the extension
npm run compile

# 5. Press F5 in VS Code to launch
```

**That's it!** LILIA is now running. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for detailed configuration.

## 🎯 What Makes LILIA Different

### The Problem With Current AI Coding Tools
- ❌ **Paywall Gatekeeping** - $20/month excludes developers in emerging markets
- ❌ **Privacy Invasion** - Your code sent to external servers
- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in** - Closed source, no transparency
- ❌ **One-size-fits-all** - Generic AI without specialization

### LILIA's Ethical Solution
- ✅ **100% Free & Open Source** - MIT licensed, community-driven
- ✅ **Local-First AI** - Ollama integration, code stays on your machine
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Intelligence** - Specialized agents for different tasks
- ✅ **Privacy by Design** - No telemetry unless you opt-in
- ✅ **Developer Empowerment** - Forkable, customizable, transparent

## Pay-wall vs. Play-wall: why I'm building LILIA

Cursor is fantastic—intelligent refactor, inline chat, multi-file edits, all the buzzwords.

It's also $20 / month, per user, after a brief free tier.

That sounds small until you notice:
- A junior dev in Lagos earns ~$400 / month.
- A computer-science class in Mumbai has 120 students.
- A hobbyist in rural Arkansas already pays $80 / month for home fibre.

Suddenly "just $20" becomes a gate, not a convenience.

### 🔒 What the pay-wall really does

**Rations talent**  
Great coders are born everywhere, but AI assistance is now a productivity multiplier. Forcing them to choose between food and autocomplete is an ethical regression.

**Kills side-projects**  
The next Django, FastAPI or Pandas often starts at 2 a.m. in a dorm. If the IDE meter is running, experimentation stops early.

**Ships your code to someone else's cloud**  
Most paid AI-IDEs send full file context to external endpoints. Trade secrets, medical, or gov-code now sit on a third-party log disk.

**Creates a two-tier profession**  
Engineers with corporate expense accounts get Copilot + Cursor + GPT-4o stacked; indie devs revert to vanilla editors. Same language, unequal weapons.

### 🌱 My answer: build LILIA

- **100% local-first**—Ollama, Llama-cpp or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint you point at.
- **One-click VS Code extension**—no new editor to learn.
- **MIT licence**—forever free, forever forkable.
- **Plug-and-play agents**—code-review, test-gen, doc-write, security-scan; enable only what you need.
- **No telemetry unless you opt-in**—your code never leaves your machine.

### 🎯 Ethical design choices I'm baking in

| Principle | LILIA approach | Cursor / paid clones |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Cost | Free, self-hosted | Subscription |
| Privacy | Local inference default | Cloud inference |
| Transparency | Open weights + open issues | Black-box models |
| Modularity | Enable / disable each agent | Bundled features |
| Community | Accept PRs, no CLA | Closed repo |

### 🚀 Call to action

- **⭐ Star or fork the repo**—signal that free, ethical AI-dev tools matter.
- **🐛 Open issues for must-have agents**; I'll prioritise community requests over my own wish-list.
- **📊 Share your GPU / CPU benchmarks** so we can publish realistic local-model performance guides—proof that "free" doesn't mean "slow".
- **🧪 If you're a student or indie, become a beta tester**—your feedback keeps the pay-wall from creeping back in disguised as "enterprise features".

### 🧩 Bottom line

Commercial editors can chase ARPU; we'll chase access.

Because ethical AI tooling isn't a luxury—it's infrastructure for the next million developers who can't expense a subscription.

Let's give them LILIA: code-assist without rent-seek, intelligence without invoices.

See you in the repo.

## Features

### Your Agent Army

Think of LILIA as your personal development team—except these teammates never sleep, never complain, and actually understand your codebase. Each agent specializes in what they do best, and they're not afraid to talk to each other when things get complex.

**The Orchestrator**: A smart manager that routes your requests to the right agent, remembers context across sessions, and coordinates multi-agent missions when you need the whole team.

**Agent Memory**: Your agents learn. They remember patterns in your code, your preferences, and the context of your project. Every interaction makes them better at helping you.

**Collaboration**: When one agent hits a wall, they call in backup. Security Agent needs Code Review's insights? They talk. Documentation Agent needs Test Generator's test cases? They collaborate. It's like having a team that actually communicates.

### The Agents

#### Code Review Agent
Your code's first critic—and its best friend. Catches bugs before they become problems, spots security holes before they become vulnerabilities, and suggests improvements that actually make sense. It's like pair programming with someone who never gets tired and always remembers best practices.

#### Test Generator Agent (Coming Soon)
Tired of writing tests? This agent reads your code and writes tests that actually matter. Not just coverage—real, meaningful tests that catch real bugs. It thinks like a developer, not a code generator.

#### Security Agent (Coming Soon)
Your code's security guard. It doesn't just scan—it understands context, recognizes patterns, and spots vulnerabilities that automated scanners miss. It knows the difference between "this is fine" and "this will get you hacked."

#### Documentation Agent (Coming Soon)
Documentation that doesn't suck. This agent reads your code, understands what it does, and writes docs that humans can actually read. It keeps them updated, too—because docs that rot are worse than no docs at all.

### AI Providers

**Ollama** (Default) - Run everything locally. Your code stays on your machine, your data stays private. No API keys, no external calls, no privacy concerns. Just pure, local AI power.

**Hugging Face** - Free APIs when you need cloud power without the cloud price tag.

**OpenAI** - Premium models when you need that extra edge. Optional, but powerful.

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new agent class extending `BaseAgent`:
   ```typescript
   import { BaseAgent } from './base-agent';
   import { AgentContext, AgentResponse } from '../types/agent';
   import { AIProvider } from '../ai/providers';

   export class MyAgent extends BaseAgent {
     constructor(aiProvider: AIProvider) {
       super('myAgent', 'My Agent', 'Description', aiProvider, []);
     }

     async process(context: AgentContext, request?: string): Promise<AgentResponse> {
       // Your agent logic here
     }
   }
   ```

2. Register it in `AgentManager.initializeAgents()`

3. Add commands in `extension.ts`

### Building

```bash
npm run compile    # Compile TypeScript
npm run watch      # Watch mode for development
```
